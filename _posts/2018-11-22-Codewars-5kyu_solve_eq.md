# Simultaneous Equations - Three Variables
#### Codewars Kata 52âˆš
##### Description
https://www.codewars.com/kata/59280c056d6c5a74ca000149/solutions/python

We have 3 equations with 3 unknowns x, y, and z and we are to solve for these unknowns.

Equations 4x -3y +z = -10, 2x +y +3z = 0, and -x +2y -5z = 17
will be passed in as an array of [[4, -3, 1, -10], [2, 1, 3, 0], [-1, 2, -5, 17]]
and the result should be returned as an array like [1, 4, -2] (i.e. [x, y, z]).

##### My solution
    import numpy as np

    def solve_eq(eq):
        lst1 = []
        lst2 = []
        for i in range(0,len(eq)):
            lst1.append(eq[i][-1])
            lst2.append(eq[i][:-1])
        rst = np.linalg.solve(lst2, lst1)
        return [int(round(x)) for x in list(rst)]

##### Given solution
    import numpy as np
    
    def solve_eq(eq):
        a = np.array([arr[:3] for arr in eq])
        b = np.array([arr[-1] for arr in eq])
        return [round(x) for x in np.linalg.solve(a,b)]
