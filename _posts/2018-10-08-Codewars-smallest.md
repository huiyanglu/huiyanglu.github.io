# Find the smallest
#### Codewars Kata 29âˆš
##### Description
You have a positive number n consisting of digits. You can do at most one operation: Choosing the index of a digit in the number, remove this digit at that index and insert it back to another place in the number.

Doing so, find the smallest number you can get.

Task: Return an array or a tuple or a string depending on the language (see "Sample Tests") with

1) the smallest number you got
2) the index i of the digit d you took, i as small as possible
3) the index j (as small as possible) where you insert this digit d to have the smallest number.
Example:

smallest(261235) --> [126235, 2, 0] or (126235, 2, 0) or "126235, 2, 0"
126235 is the smallest number gotten by taking 1 at index 2 and putting it at index 0

smallest(209917) --> [29917, 0, 1] or ...

[29917, 1, 0] could be a solution too but index `i` in [29917, 1, 0] is greater than 
index `i` in [29917, 0, 1].
29917 is the smallest number gotten by taking 2 at index 0 and putting it at index 1 which gave 029917 which is the number 29917.

smallest(1000000) --> [1, 0, 6] or ...
Note
Have a look at "Sample Tests" to see the input and output in each language
  
##### My solution  
    def smallest(n):
        n2 = [i for i in str(n)]
        x = []
        for i,n in enumerate(n2):
            ns = list(n2)
            ns.pop(i)
            for j in range(len(n2)):
                x2 = list(ns)
                x2.insert(j,n)
                x2 = int(''.join(x2))
                x.append([x2,i,j])
        return min(x,key = lambda x:x[0])

##### Given solutions  
    def smallest(n):
      s = str(n)
      min1, from1, to1 = n, 0, 0
      for i in range(len(s)):
        removed = s[:i] + s[i+1:]
        for j in range(len(removed)+1):
          num = int(removed[:j] + s[i] + removed[j:])
          if (num < min1):
            min1, from1, to1 = num, i, j
      return [min1, from1, to1]

    def smallest(n):
        s = list(str(n))
        def swap(i, p):
            t = s[:]
            t.insert(i, t.pop(p))
            return int(''.join(t))
        return min([swap(i, p), p, i] for i in range(len(s)) for p in range(len(s)))

    def smallest(n):
        s, mem = str(n), [-1, -1, -1]
        tmp, l = s, len(s)
        for i in range(l):
            c = s[i]
            str1 = s[:i] + s[i + 1:]
            for j in range(0, l):
                str2 = str1[:j] + c + str1[j:]
                if (str2 < tmp):
                    tmp = str2
                    mem = [int(tmp), i, j]
        if (mem[0] == -1): mem = [n, 0, 0]
        return mem
